# NPX Business Card

This is a `npx` business card relating to Brid Moynihan. This command can be run directly via the console or terminal.

This mini node project uses [`cowsay`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay) node library to generate a classic `ASCII` character to go with my business card.
